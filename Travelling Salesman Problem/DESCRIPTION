The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:
   Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
      what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? 

It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

Various heuristics and approximation algorithms, which quickly yield good solutions have been devised.
Modern methods can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions of cities)
   within a reasonable time which are with a high probability just 2â€“3% away from the optimal solution.

//SOLUTIONS//
//1 The nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (or so-called greedy algorithm) lets the salesman choose the nearest unvisited city as his next move.
This algorithm quickly yields an effectively short route. For N cities randomly distributed on a plane,
   the algorithm on average yields a path 25% longer than the shortest possible path.
However, there exist many specially arranged city distributions which make the NN algorithm give the worst route (Gutin, Yeo, and Zverovich, 2002).

//2 The Christofides algorithm follows a similar outline but combines the minimum spanning tree with a solution of another problem,
   minimum-weight perfect matching. This gives a TSP tour which is at most 1.5 times the optimal. 
The Christofides algorithm was one of the first approximation algorithms,
   and was in part responsible for drawing attention to approximation algorithms as a practical approach to intractable problems.
As a matter of fact, the term "algorithm" was not commonly extended to approximation algorithms until later; 
   the Christofides algorithm was initially referred to as the Christofides heuristic.
